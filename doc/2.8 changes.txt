Please note that in stable versions only critical bugs will be fixed, so
if you are using a stable version (i.e. 2.8) you should always be using
the latest build for that version.

Beta versions are where all the new/modified features appear. As new
features are quite likely to contain bugs we recommend keeping an eye on
the Gravity forums where we will let you know which builds are considered
"stable", hence only download the very latest builds if you are either
helping us to debug and add new features, or you don't mind being at the
"bleeding edge" (hint : its called "bleeding" for a reason!!)

Gravity Version 2.7 Open Source Change Log

Note: ! make backups of FILTER.DAT and FILTER2.DAT !
       there are some backward compatibility issues

=========================================================================

Build 2067 Removed locale settings that were causing posting problems
           for non-US settings

Build 2066

  [+] NEW - Spell checking with MySpell. Read these instructions

     a) The dictionary and the .aff file should be put into the
        Gravity\spell directory

     b) Manually create the "mywords.lst" in the spell directory;  this 
        is the customized words to ignore list

  [+] NEW - adds character sets: 8859-13, 8859-14, 8859-16

  [+] NEW - added a Article -> Character coding menu item. Sets
      a default character set for articles that do not have a
      Content-type, Content-transfer-encoding header.

      (I think this does not work on "From" and "Subject" at this
       point)

  [-] FIXED - relaxed a MIME boundary thing. Encoded words without
      spaces did not display decoded. The posting software (OE) is
      technically wrong, but Gravity handles it.

  [-] FIXED - fixed a weird Tagging selection problem that was in
      most earlier Gravity versions.


===========================================================================

Build 2.7 2064

  [+] NEW - Additional charset support

      - UTF-8
      - UTF-7 (read only)
      - Windows 125x (read only)
      - KOIR-8
      - Tweaked RFC 2047 to display some incorrectly encoded stuff

  [+] NEW - Re-Wrapping, use CONTROL-W (thanks Jon Skeet). It
      works in the follow up window.

  [+] NEW - Reply-To: 7-bit also displays nicely instead of
      ?iso-8859-1?q?= stuff. 

  Note: to see the char set effects you may need to unsubscribe
        and resubscribe to the newsgroup. Also, some fonts are limited.
        "Lucinda Sans Unicode" works good as well as some others.
        (If you use GIMP you can see which fonts have a large amount
         of characters with the text tool)

Most of the following were rolled in from 2.6 2060 (not open source)

  [+] NEW - "Repair URL" command (right click in article pane) allows you
      to send a wrapped URL to the browser.
      Usage: Highlight the entire URL - right click - select "Repair URL"


  [+] NEW - "Back to Draft" command sends an article from the
      Outbox back to the draft folder for re-editing. It is
      intended to replace the "Back to Editing" button that
      was in earlier versions

  [+] NEW - "Decode to" command overrides the decode directories
      Command: "Article - Decode to .." I think this was there,
      but rolled back into 2.6

  [+] NEW - Check box to turn on/off X-Faces
      Command: View - Global Options - Display - Show X-Faces

  [-] FIXED - Created date in draft message window

  [-] FIXED - URL highlighting works as it did before. Copying an URL
      with the mouse does not cause the link to open the browser.
