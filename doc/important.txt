If you use the open source version you should understand the following

- Installation : Gravity uses a single, packaged installer. the installer
  *may* need to download the latest version of Microsoft Installer if it
  is not present on your system, but it will only need to do this if you
  have not installed anything or used Windows Update in the past year or
  so.

- To uninstall or repair Gravity please use Windows "Add/Remove Programs"
  in Control Panel.


KNOWN INSTALLATION PROBLEMS
---------------------------
None at this time.


OTHER NOTES
-----------

- Versions 2.9 and later will not modify an installation of an earlier
  version (2.7 or 2.8). They detect this installation when first started
  and the user has the option of importing the database and settings of
  this earlier version.
  (PLEASE NOTE IF YOU INSTALL v2.9 TO THE SAME LOCATION AS AN EARLIER
  VERSION IT WILL OVERWRITE THE PROGRAM FILES, it will still give you
  the opportunity to import the database and settings and will not touch
  these in the old installtion)

- Versions 2.9 and later have a much improved spell checker. Highlighting
  of the mis-spelled word, user entry of corrected words and other
  improvements.

- If you have a copy of Gallery it should work, but Gallery is no longer
  distibuted with the open-source distributions

- Gravity now has incorporated database Import/Export functionality.
  DO NOT USE GravityBackup, it is incompatible with Gravity versions
  2.9 onwards.

- New help files (that are compatible with Windows Vista and windows 7)
  have been finished are now included.

- Gravity (2.9 onwards) is fully compatible with Vista and Windows 7,
  32 and 64 bit. Please note that Gravity now creates individual data
  files for each user so every user can have their own settings and
  subscribed newsgroups.

- Gravity is constantly being developed, new features added, bugs fixed.
  In the download area of Gravitys SourceForge website you will notice
  there are multiple versions of Gravity available. All you need to know
  is we recommend you download the latest STABLE version.
  
  STABLE versions can be recognised by checking out the second number in
  the version number. i.e. 3.0 is a stable version (the number '0' is
  even), 3.1 is a development build, 3.2 will be the next stable build.

  (Development builds are for developers and other people who don't mind
  the occasional crash and are happy to test out new features for us)
