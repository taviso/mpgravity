A brief history of Microplanet gravity
======================================

Gravity has been a popular Usenet client since 1996.
Originally, Gravity was shareware, written and developed
by MicroPlanet Inc.(Version 1.0). Gravity was selected
as PC Magazine's Editor's Choice in October 1996.

Gravity was acquired by Anawave briefly (Version 2.0),
then re-acquired by MicroPlanet. Numerous features were
added over these years, including multiple server support
and scoring. The last shareware version was 2.3. In
November 2000 MicroPlanet gave away Gravity as freeware
(Version 2.5).

After this period, Al Choy, co-founder of MicroPlanet,
continued improvements and unofficial releases known
as "Super Gravity" (Versions 2.6). These unoffical versions
were available from 2001 through 2004. Al continued to
add features including preliminary MIME support and
8-bit character support.

Al later stripped out licensed proprietary code, set up the
SourceForge project and made the source code available under
the BSD License. Regular expressions were replaced with
PCREs. These Builds were numbered 2.7 (2.7.0) with the
last version 2.7.0 Build 2067, dated August 1, 2004.

In August 2008 Richard Wood began compiling Gravity on newer
development platforms optimized for Windows XP, restoring
some lost functionality, improving performance, as well as
adding numerous tweaks and new features. These builds begin
with Version 2.7.1, Build 1. With Version 2.8.2, a newer
development environment provides better support for Windows
Vista and Windows 7, as well as multi user installation options.



The current stable version of Gravity is 2.8 Build 2 (2.8.2)


All information in this file ONLY applies to older versions of Gravity.
It is supplied purely for historical interest and reference only.

I repeat, NONE of the bugs, registry tweaks or anything else detailed
in this file need to be done for Gravity 2.8 or later.

If you use the open source version you should understand the following


- Version 2.7.1b and later have a minimal spell checker.

- If you are upgrading from a version older than 2.6 Build 2057 :-
  + PCREs. Gravity now uses Perl Compatible Regular Expressions.
    Please read the following issues regarding REs.

  * If Gravity is already installed the following registry change
    MUST be made to recognize binary parts (and for the
    "Complete_Binaries" Filter to work)

	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MicroPlanet\Gravity\System
        Change DecodeRE-Parts to  ([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)

        For reference, the previous default is: [0-9]+$b/[0-9]+$c

  *  Rules/filters/scoring that use REs must be changed (if necessary)

- If you have copies of Gallery and Backup they should work, but they
  are not distibuted with open-source distributions
