2.9.1 Built 11/06/2009 (never released)

  [+] Upgraded Gravity and installer. Gravity is now compatible with Vista
      and Windows 7, following Microsoft conventions for user data storage.
      In English this means that you can have multiple users on one PC and
      they can each have their own set of settings and newsgroups. What
      one user does does not affect any other user.
      Old settings and newsgroup files, provided they haven't been moved,
      are detected and imported.
      Please note that if Gravity is to be used by more than one person
      on the PC it must be installed by an administrator into the
      recommended location. Once installed both administrator and standard
      users can use Gravity.
  [+] Upgraded to allow multiple versions of Gravity to co-exist.
      Each different version of Gravity from 2.9 onwards has its own
      database folder and its own registry settings.
  [+] Added database and settings export and import. The archive file
      format is Microsoft CAB(inet) compressed format and the files within
      can be viewed and extracted with Microsoft Explorer.
  [+] Enhanced spell checker, added edit box to enter your own words.
  [+] Added new on-line installer, 350k download!
      (For people without access to broadband the off-line installer will
      continue to be available)
  [-] Fixed error in Initial Setup dialog where the user could not quit.


Please note that this is a BETA version. This is where new/modified
features appear. Beta versions also act as a test platform for the next
Stable version when quite a lot of things have been changed and the
software needs a more thorough test by fellow beta testers.
