  [+] Added : Changed Server Setup dialog into a wizard with improved UI.
  [+] Added : Add ability to customise signature font size + colour.
  [+] Upgraded : Spell Checked upgraded to Hunspell.
  [+] Enhanced spell checker, added edit box to enter your own words.
  [+] Added : English, GB spell checker dictionaries.
  [+] Ugraded : English, US dictionaries upgraded.
  [+] Added : Search dialog now has a "Search Headers" option which
      allows searching in the FULL raw header text, using plain text
      or regular expressions. Note the article has to be local or it
      will be downloaded, just like searching in the body.
  [+] Added : Rule and Filter BODY checking now also checks the HEADER
      text so you can use reg exprs to check any header fields you want.
  [+] Enhanced : Score and Lines columns have extra space added to RHS
      to improve visual appearance.
  [+] Enhanced : Thread pane header control columns : All titles are now
      centre aligned and the incorrect "space" on the LHS has gone.
  [+] Added : Export and Import of News Server
  [+] Added : Command line Import of News Server for ISP use.
  [+] Added import button on first startup screen.
  [+] Upgraded Gravity and installer. Gravity is now compatible with Vista
      and Windows 7, following Microsoft conventions for user data storage.
      In English this means that you can have multiple users on one PC and
      they can each have their own set of settings and newsgroups. What
      one user does does not affect any other user.
      Old settings and newsgroup files, provided they haven't been moved,
      are detected and imported.
      Please note that if Gravity is to be used by more than one person
      on the PC it must be installed by an administrator into the
      recommended location. Once installed both administrator and standard
      users can use Gravity.
  [+] Upgraded to allow multiple versions of Gravity to co-exist.
      Each different version of Gravity from 2.9 onwards has its own
      database folder and its own registry settings.
  [+] Added database and settings export and import. The archive file
      format is Microsoft CAB(inet) compressed format and the files within
      can be viewed and extracted with Microsoft Explorer.
  [+] Changed the installer so it includes the required Microsoft libraries
      as opposed to downloading them.
  [-] Due to the above, the Online and Offline installers were approximately
      the same size so the Offline Installer has been dropped.

  [-] Fixed : Foreign month names caused crash.
